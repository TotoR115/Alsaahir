# **Alsaahir kit for BG2**

Version: 5.0  
Author: TotoR   
Languagues: English and French

## **I. Introduction:**

I created this kit to add a different feeling with bards: some touch of oriental myth mixed with ADnD and was created with two things in mind:

    Wisdom is useless for bards -> make it usefull
    Bards are poor fighters and as they can't wear armor and casts spells at the same times, they are less protected than mages and thieves in BG1 -> give them some natural resistance and better fighting skills.

So with this kit :

    more Wisdom give you more spells at the cost of 1 spell less per level
    you can mastering (***) some weapons at the cost of the bard's natural versatility in weapons.
    You will also gain some natural protection and abilities that protect you from weapons

In consequence you will now choose if you want to go more towards fighter (constitutuion) or wizard (wisdom).

## **III. How and when should this mod be installed:**

This mod should be installed just like all other WeiDU mods. Unzip the mod to the Main Directory of Baldur's Gate 2. Then, run the Setup-Alsaahir.exe file. After doing this, you will be asked about the installation of the mod.

I usually install Kit mods after mods that add or revise spells.
