**Alsaahir kit for BG2**

Version: 1.0  
Author: TotoR   
Languagues: English and French

**I. Introduction:**

I created this kit to have a different feeling of bards, with some touch of oriental myth mixed with Adnd. 

This kit was created with two things in mind:
- Wisdom is useless for bards -> make it usefull
- They are poor fighters and can't wear armor and casts spells at the same times, making them less protected than mages and thieves in BG1 -> give them some natural resistance and more fighting skills.

with this kit, more Wisdom give you more spells and you can mastering (***) some weapons at the cost of the bard's natural versatility in weapons. 

At creation, You will now choose if you want to go more towards fighter (constitutuion but less spells) or wizard (wisdom but less hp).

**II. The Kit**

ALSAAHIR: like a snake charmer, this bard has chosen to study the sensibility of fiends and undeads to vibrations and sounds. However, practicing with demons or undeads is a dangerous game and those who survive the firsts encounters never come back unhurt, physically and mentally. This path need to mastering the art of illusions, some wisdom and more fighter's training than a bard at the expense of his natural versatility and dexterity.

Advantages:
-  Can use the Alsaahir'song. This song further improves with levels

-  Gains 1/2 attack bonus at level 8
-  Can achieve mastery in daggers, scimitars and maces
-  like an Illusionist Specialist, cast spell with +2/-2 saves against illusion spells
-  knowledge of demons and undead is the prime necessity. Like a cleric, wisdom will increase the number of spell cast by level.

Disadvantages:
-  Only has one-half normal lore and Pick Pockets
-  Can't be proficient in other weapon than daggers, scimitars, and maces and can't put slots in two weapons fighting style

**III. How and when should this mod be installed:**

This mod should be installed just like all other WeiDU mods. Unzip the mod to the Main Directory of Baldur's Gate 2. Then, run the Setup-Alsaahir.exe file. After doing this, you will be asked about the installation of the mod.

I usually install Kit mods after mods that have new spells.
